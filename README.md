# Simple Bipods - Second Edition
A mod for PAYDAY 2 that aims to simplify bipods, allow for greater freedom when deploying them, and make them functionally consistent.

This edition includes changes that may not be compatible with LMG Steelsights mod and custom bipod-equipped weapons that lack built-in support. You can read about adding support to your weapons [here](https://github.com/Krimzin/Simple-Bipods/wiki/Writing-Bipod-Stances).

### Features
- Camera pitch is no longer a condition for deployment.
- Rays that check for obstructions have been greatly reduced in length.
- Rays that check if a bipod can be deployed are now offset from the player camera and not the bipod.

### Dependencies
- [SuperBLT](https://superblt.znix.xyz/)

### Installation
- Unpack the archive into your mods folder (â€¦\PAYDAY 2\mods).
